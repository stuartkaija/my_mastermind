// initial prompt, on launching the program via the command line, will also take in the secret code with the flag "-c" i.e. ./my_mastermind -c "0123" - if the c flag is omitted, a random code will be generated, i.e. if ac is 1, generate the random code - except we're using a make file, so not sure how this will be implemented yet

// code to generate random 4 digits
// code to accept player's input
// code to compare player's input to secret code, checking and keeping track of well placed pieces and misplaced pieces
    // check if input is correct i.e. digits from 0 to 8
    // for well placed pieces - should this be stored globally, so as when it reaches 4 (i.e. all pieces are well placed), the player has won the game?
// input validation

// the count for well placed pieces and misplaced pieces will then be displayed to the player
// code to keep track of rounds (there are 10 rounds)
